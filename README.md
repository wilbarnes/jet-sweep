sweep your digital assets to higher interest accounts

[Investopedia definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweepaccount.asp): 
* A sweep account automatically transfers cash funds into a safe but higher interest-earning investment option at the close of each business day, e.g. into a money market fund.
* Sweep accounts try to minimize idle cash drag.
* A sweep account service, however, may not always be free - and you might have to pay fees to your broker that might make the sweep not as attractive on a net basis.
